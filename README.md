# FPGA-project-using-Vivado-and-VHDL
The code is a requirement for a lab work that introduces us to the Vivado software and VHDL programming. 

The code is used to build and test the following circuit using the Vivado software and VHDL programming.

###  Learning Goals of the project 
- Program using VHDL code to design a digital module. 
- Learn how to analyze the logical diagram of our design (from RTL Analysis->Schematic)
- Understand the FPGA design (from Synthesis->Run Synthesis)
- Understand the FPGA “Synthesized Diagram” from Synthesized Design-> Schematic.
- Find out how many lookup tables and I/O blocks used to implement our system.
- Figure out how to see the truth table of each lookup table used in our system.
- Utilize a test-bench file to test our module by simulation on Vivado.
- Using the timing diagram results to analyze the simulation results. 
- learn how to navigate through the timing diagram using the time marker and how to check the values of the inputs/outputs at any time on the timing diagram.
